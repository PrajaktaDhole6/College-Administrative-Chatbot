Shreya Daga B.Tech Final Year : Electronics  Telecommunications As Albert Einstein \\naptly remarked, Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think. My \\ncollege journey perfectly encapsulates this sentiment. Embarking on my journey within the \\nDepartment of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at VIT, we follow a curriculum where \\nthe range of subjects extends beyond mere theoretical concepts. It strongly emphasised handson \\nexperiences, equipping me with practical skills crucial for the everevolving engineering field. \\nEngaging in research projects each semester has been a pivotal aspect of my academic pursuit, \\nproviding a unique opportunity to explore the latest technological advancements while contributing \\nmeaningfully to societal progress. The culmination of these projects, resulting in the publication of \\nmultiple research papers, has left a tangible mark on my academic journey. Regular opportunities to \\npresent my work and gain constructive feedback from industry experts have refined my technical \\nunderstanding and broadened my professional vision. Beyond technical proficiency, the departments \\nunwavering support has undoubtedly played a significant role in cultivating my interpersonal skills. \\nWith deep gratitude, I extend my appreciation to the department and the institute for consistently \\nexposing me to a diverse range of academic and other activities, thus opening my eyes to many \\nopportunities. Dyuti Bobby B.Tech Final Year : Electronics  Telecommunications For me, the \\nElectronics and Telecommunication department at our institution has been a lifechanging experience \\nsince the department not only provides theoretical information but also a practical, projectcentric \\napproach that closes the knowledge gap between industry and academics. My comprehension of \\ncomplex subjects has significantly improved as a result of the emphasis on handson learning through \\na variety of projects. During my formative years in the Department of Electronics and \\nTelecommunication, I participated in various hackathons. I was even successful in winning one of the \\nprestigious statelevel IoT competitions and signing an MoU for the same project in collaboration with \\nSmart QR Technologies. Not only this, but the department also encourages and supports us for paper \\nand patent publications as part of our academics. During my third year, I had the opportunity to work \\non a governmentaided sponsored project under the Central Water and Power Research Station \\n(CWPRS), Pune organisation.

Recently, while we heard Shubha and her \\nfriends discuss about the approaching farewell, we had a flashback of the four years she spent in the \\ninstitute and its contribution in her growth. The first year was marked with enthusiasm, anxiety and \\nhappiness associated with pursuing technical studies along with various extracurricular activities. \\nWorking with a team in miniprojects, publicity campaigns, sponsorship committee, theatre etc. have \\nhelped her transform into an individual with a dynamic personality. The various elective subjects \\nfocusing on professional ethics and technical skills including foreign languages have definitely given \\nthe students an exposure to the world beyond technical studies. Moving to the department of \\nInstrumentation and Control in the second year opened new vistas for her. The department faculty \\nhas always been supportive in not only academics but also in extracurricular activities like \\nFirodiyaKarandak. Shubha was fortunate to be an exchange student for one semester during her \\nthird year of engineering at the University of Western Ontario, Canada. That was one of the best \\nexperiences she had in developing world views. On account of various such opportunities provided \\nby the department, Shubha could be the recipient of the International Society of Automations \\nScholarship for the 201516 academic year.Interactions with Industries and organization of various \\ncompetitions like Mitsubishi Electric Cup hasprovided the much needed exposure and inspiration to \\nthe students. The department has been extremely cooperative and supportive in all her endeavors \\nthroughout these years. All in all, as parents, we see that the institute has prepared its students very \\nwell to step into the competitive world. The skills and values inculcated in them would definitely \\nmake them stand out from the rest while they pursue their choice of career. Thank you.

Recently, while we heard Shubha and her \\nfriends discuss about the approaching farewell, we had a flashback of the four years she spent in the \\ninstitute and its contribution in her growth. The first year was marked with enthusiasm, anxiety and \\nhappiness associated with pursuing technical studies along with various extracurricular activities. \\nWorking with a team in miniprojects, publicity campaigns, sponsorship committee, theatre etc. have \\nhelped her transform into an individual with a dynamic personality. The various elective subjects \\nfocusing on professional ethics and technical skills including foreign languages have definitely given \\nthe students an exposure to the world beyond technical studies. Moving to the department of \\nInstrumentation and Control in the second year opened new vistas for her. The department faculty \\nhas always been supportive in not only academics but also in extracurricular activities like \\nFirodiyaKarandak. Shubha was fortunate to be an exchange student for one semester during her \\nthird year of engineering at the University of Western Ontario, Canada. That was one of the best \\nexperiences she had in developing world views. On account of various such opportunities provided \\nby the department, Shubha could be the recipient of the International Society of Automations \\nScholarship for the 201516 academic year.Interactions with Industries and organization of various \\ncompetitions like Mitsubishi Electric Cup hasprovided the much needed exposure and inspiration to \\nthe students. The department has been extremely cooperative and supportive in all her endeavors \\nthroughout these years. All in all, as parents, we see that the institute has prepared its students very \\nwell to step into the competitive world. The skills and values inculcated in them would definitely \\nmake them stand out from the rest while they pursue their choice of career. Thank you.

Slide 3 It gives me great pleasure to \\nreflect back on my experience with VIT  my alma mater. I am truly indebted to VIT for transforming \\nan average engineering student like me into capable professional engineer in the field of Control \\nEngineering. My journey on Engineering course started back in year 2003 with VITInstrumentation \\nand Control department. While working through my Engineering degree at VIT, I realized that \\nexperienced faculty members who are subject matter experts in various fields layout strong \\nfoundation for dynamic academic program at Instrumentation department. Student friendly faculty \\nand supporting staff creates conducive academic ecosystem for any student to thrive on it. State of \\nart laboratories for DCS , PLC , Process Instrumentation etc. at Instrumentation department helped \\nme tremendously to see how theories taught in classroom being applied to real world applications. \\nApart from academics, I was able to enjoy extracurricular activities through college festivals and \\ncompetitions which are undoubtedly special college memories to cherish lifelong for any engineer. \\nTraining and Placement at VIT sets it apart from masses when it comes to transitioning from \\nacademic to professional environment at the end of curriculum. Symbiotic relationship between \\nleading automation companies and VIT helps students to give right head start into their early career. I \\nwas able to secure employment with Honeywell Automation India Ltd. via strong platform provided \\nby VIT Instrumentation and Control department. This early encouragement in my career helped me \\nto further pursue Master of Science degree at USA. On concluding note, I would like to thank \\neveryone at VIT who helped me achieve my academic goals and gave me lifetime experience during \\nmy formative years.

            "content='\"Attention\" refers to a cognitive process that allows us to selectively concentrate on certain aspects of our environment or internal thoughts while ignoring others.  It\\'s a crucial component of perception, memory, and learning, enabling us to efficiently navigate a complex world filled with constant stimuli.  Think of it as a spotlight that illuminates specific information, making it more prominent in our conscious awareness.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of key aspects of attention:\\n\\n* **Selectivity:**  Attention allows us to choose what we focus on.  For example, in a noisy cafe, you can choose to focus on your conversation partner\\'s voice while filtering out the surrounding chatter.\\n\\n* **Capacity:**  Attention has a limited capacity. We can only attend to a certain amount of information at a time.  Trying to focus on too many things at once leads to decreased performance in all areas.\\n\\n* **Sustained Attention (Vigilance):** This refers to the ability to maintain focus on a task or stimulus over an extended period.  Think of air traffic controllers who need to maintain vigilance for long durations.\\n\\n* **Divided Attention:** This involves attending to multiple stimuli or tasks simultaneously.  For example, driving a car while listening to the radio requires divided attention.  However, our ability to truly divide attention is limited, and often involves rapidly switching focus between tasks.\\n\\n* **Shifting Attention:** This is the ability to flexibly shift our focus from one stimulus or task to another.  For example, reading a book and then looking up to answer a question requires shifting attention.\\n\\n* **Types of Attention:**\\n    * **Focused Attention:**  Concentrating on a single stimulus while ignoring distractions.\\n    * **Sustained Attention:** Maintaining focus on a task over time.\\n    * **Selective Attention:** Choosing specific stimuli to attend to while ignoring others.\\n    * **Alternating Attention:** Switching focus back and forth between different tasks.\\n    * **Divided Attention:** Attempting to attend to multiple stimuli or tasks simultaneously.\\n\\n**Neural Basis of Attention:**  Attention is a complex process involving various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, parietal lobes, and subcortical structures like the thalamus and superior colliculus.  These regions work together to filter information, prioritize relevant stimuli, and allocate cognitive resources.\\n\\n**Factors Affecting Attention:**  Various factors can influence attention, including:\\n\\n* **Arousal:**  A moderate level of arousal' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'MAX_TOKENS', 'model_name': 'gemini-1.5-pro-002', 'safety_ratings': []} id='run-5e41cb0b-485a-484a-86e4-90da55ddd0f6-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3, 'output_tokens': 500, 'total_tokens': 503, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}\n"
